# RsTopArtists

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/rs_top_artists`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rs_top_artists'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rs_top_artists

## Usage

Run the exec file rs_top_artists. User will be prompted if they would like to view the Rolling Stone's Top 100 Artist list. If not, they will exit the program with a goodbye. If yes, they will be given a list of the artists. Then the user can select by number which artist they would like more information on. Once selected, a paragraph about the artist
is printed to stdout. User is then prompted if they would like to see the list again and select another artist to view. If this is done three times consecutively the user is brought to selection by group. Here the user can select a group of 10 artists to see a list of 10 artists together. Then the program exits.
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
